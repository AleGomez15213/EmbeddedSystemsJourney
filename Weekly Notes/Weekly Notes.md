Weekly notes will document my learning for the week. Each week I will learn a new topic or continue my learning of a previous one. Because my understanding of specific topics may change/grow, I will constantly be updating these notes.

**Note:** Note: I will also try to add notes from my classes in the event that my class topics intersect with what I am learning on the side but this repository is primarily meant to document project notes as opposed to university notes.
