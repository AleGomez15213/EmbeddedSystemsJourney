The "Projects" folder will contain any and all projects I work on. It will have detailed documentation of the goal and process I go through to complete these projects. Projects will focus on having a minimal viable product by the end of the project session.

# Sub Projects
Because some projects are very big and will require a large amount of prerequisite information, I will attempt to split the project into **smaller projects focused on learning how the technology works rather than completing a finished product.** 

## Ideology
Oftentimes when coding, it is better to create an isolated environment where we can test code without the worry that other libraries, settings, or procedures will interfere with the testing process. With bigger projects, it is easy to get lost in all of the requirements of the project, that it makes it harder to test even the simpler services or tech. Therefore, in order to complete (some) bigger projects, I will create smaller, bite-sized, Sub Projects.

These sub projects will help me have an isolated mindset where I can more comfortably explore the capabilities of the technology I am using without worrying that it will interfere with the goals of the larger task. **Each sub project is still geared towards developing something for the larger projects.**

Sometimes these smaller projects will be directly implemented into the larger one, other times they are just meant to help me gain prerequisite experience. Regardless, the the goal is to complete whatever larger project I choose without burning out by splitting up the work/learning into smaller digestible bites.

### Example
- **Main Project** is designing an [[Embedded Systems Smartwatch]]
	- **Sub Projects** include [[Custom STm32 driver for gyroscope]]
	- [[Interfacing with a touchscreen]]
