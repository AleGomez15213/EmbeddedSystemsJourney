# Purpose
The purpose of this site is to document my journey as I deepen my understanding of Embedded Systems and any other adjacent topics I run into. This site will include weekly notes, project information, and (minimal) university notes. The goal is to be able to tangibly measure my knowledge and experience as an Embedded Systems Engineer.

Note that I am not starting this from scratch. I am a Computer Engineering major with knowledge on microcontrollers, computer architecture, digital circuit analysis, etc. There is however gaps in my understanding that I would like to fill hence why I am doing this documentation.
